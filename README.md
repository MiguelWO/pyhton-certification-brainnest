# Brainntest Python Course Certification

This repository contains the assignments and class exercises I completed as part of the Brainntest Python Course Certification.

The Brainntest Python Course was an amazing learning experience for me. Throughout the course, I learned the fundamentals of Python programming language, including data types, control structures, functions, object-oriented programming, and file handling.

Overall, I am very grateful for the opportunity to participate in this course, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn Python programming language.
